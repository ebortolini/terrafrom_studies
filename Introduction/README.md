 Is a declarative language.

 It will do the work of going from current state to the desired state.

 It does that in three phases:
 
 **Init:** Initializes the project identifying the providers.

**Plan:** Drafts a plan to get to desired state.

**Apply**: Aplies the plan.

Every object terraform manages is called a resource.
